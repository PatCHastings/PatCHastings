- 👋 Hi, I’m @PatCHastings
- 👀 I’m interested in discovery, how things work, and how to create aesthetically pleasing art via whichever medium necessary. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code at WeCanCodeIT bootcamp, and it was such a great decision. I am going to love what I do. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating projects to build a solid portfolio. 
- 📫 You can reach me at phastings82@gmail.com
